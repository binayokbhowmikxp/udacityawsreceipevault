# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Disable SSH password login
2. Allow access to the instance via AWS SSM.
3. Allow access only via certain trusted IP address e.g Hardened Bastion Host

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. IAM Role attached to the instance should have least priviledge access policy. It should not have access to S3 secret receipe bucket.
2. Restrict access using S3 bucket policy in s3 secret receipe bucket

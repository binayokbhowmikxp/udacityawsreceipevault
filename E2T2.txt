4. S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer

5. Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest

6. Well known port such as ftp , telnet. syslog etc are reachable from internet.


Recommendation:

1. Remove access to web server from 0.0.0.0/0 and move the web server to the private group . Create a Bastion Host (hardened) and allow only login from Bastion host
2. Enable versioning and SSL in the two S3 buckets
3. EBS volumes should be encrypted.

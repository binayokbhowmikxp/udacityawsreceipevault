# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Move the web-server to the private subnet , Make the web server instance immutable (no logins allowed even via keys)

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No VPC endpoint won't secure it. Additional S3 bucket policy (resource policy) would make it more secure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No it will encrypt new data

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

It will revert back to the original settings

Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

The "Web Service Instance" should be in the private subnet and the the security group attached to the web server should allow traffic only from the Application Load Balancer
i.e WebAppSG should allow traffic only from security group of ALB. In case if login required to this server then it should be from Bastion host (of course shoudl be hardened)
This will ensure that the access to the web server is restricted and controlled.

# Poor practice 2

VPC endpoint should be created to access S3 and both the S3 bucket should have Bucket policy granted only those required (least previledge access).
This will ensure only the trusted and authorized ones are accessing the S3 bucket.
